# Personal Ansible Config

this is an ansible configuration that I created for practice and for learning
as well as a set of bash scripts that are useful for managing the configuration files
on my laptop

the ansible scripts transfer these files around the network and configure my local net
with the nice user configs im used to

as allways feel free to look around, and use at your own risk
